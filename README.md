Project Title: OOPS and DS Implementation

Description:

This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts and Data Structures (DS) in [programming language, e.g., Python, Java, C++].

OOPS Concepts Implemented:

1. Classes and Objects
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Encapsulation
5. Abstraction
Data Structures Implemented:

1. Arrays
2. Linked Lists
3. Stacks
4. Queues
5. Trees (Binary Search Tree)
6. Graphs

Features:

- Implementation of OOPS concepts using real-world examples
- Implementation of various Data Structures with operations (insertion, deletion, traversal, etc.)
- Test cases for each Data Structure to demonstrate its functionality
Requirements:

- [Programming language, e.g., Python, Java, C++]
- [Any specific libraries or frameworks used]

Usage:

1. Clone the repository using git clone
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile and run the code using [compiler/runtime environment, e.g., javac, python]
